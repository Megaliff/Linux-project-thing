# Linux project thingy

A linux distro that is currently WIP. Don't mind this for now. It will probably contain apps that are for computing and science stuff. Here I'll upload the files and stuff. 

Also, if you're wondering this distro is based on Debian, made using Linux Live Kit

# What you need to do... or at least that's what I think:

- First, download the repo. Now, the core file is currently missing for some reason, so here is the link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/11W0JOJlnBXzfW3yrP4-mJgksB5odSdA1/view?usp=share_link. Place the .sb file onto the linux folder]
- Find and read the boot.txt in the LinuxProject folder if you want to know how to make bootable media (CD/DVD, USB stick, whatever)

Ig that's it, k bye
