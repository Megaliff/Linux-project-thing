# Linux project thingy

A linux distro that is currently WIP. Don't mind this for now. It will probably contain apps that are for computing and science stuff. Here I'll upload the files and stuff. 

Also, if you're wondering this distro is based on Debian, made using Linux Live Kit

Ig that's it, k bye
