# Linux project thingy

A linux distro that is currently WIP. Don't mind this for now
It will probably contain apps that are for computing and science stuff
Here I'll upload the iso file and other stuff later

Also, if you're wondering this distro is based on Debian, made using Linux Live Kit

# Instructions:

- First, download the repo. Now, the core file is currently missing for some reason, so here is the link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/11W0JOJlnBXzfW3yrP4-mJgksB5odSdA1/view?usp=share_link. Place the .sb file onto linux/boot]
- Copy all of these into a CD or USB stick, now you'll have a bootable media. Or, you could put all of these into an ISO file if you want to run it in a virtual machine. 

Ig that's it, k bye
